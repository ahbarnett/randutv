@function [U,T,V]=randutv(A,nb,pp,niter)
% RANDUTV  compute UTV decomposition (approximate SVD) via randomized methods
%
% [U,T,V] = randutv(A) basic usage
%   A must be a double-precision real matrix.
%
% [U,T,V] = randutv(A,nb,pp,niter) also controls options:
%   nb:       Block size. Usual values for nb are 32, 64, etc.
%   pp:       Oversampling size. Usual values for pp are 5, 10, etc.
%   niter:    Number of "power" iterations. Usual values are 0,1,2.
%
% Notes:
% 1) MEX interface to multi-threaded lapack-compatible implementation
%    NoFLA_UTV_WY_blk_var2.c by Martinsson, Quintana-Orti and Heavner, 2016.
%    For details see: https://github.com/flame/randutv
% 2) A is copied to new matrix which is overwritten by T. Matlab interface
%    could be extended so that input A is overwritten instead by T.

% documentation was unclear: A is overwritten by T! Thus need copy A to T:
%T = zeros(m,n);  % allocates new T
T = A;           % forces to copy A in

% MATLAB preallocation of U,V needed since it's 'inout' type, to allow
% later case of U,V being inputs too (which I don't understand...)
U = zeros(m,m);
V = zeros(n,n);
