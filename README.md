## Description

This code repository contains several implementations 
of an algorithm for computing a so called UTV factorization efficiently.

Given a matrix A, the algorithm `randUTV` 
computes a factorization A = U T V<sup>t</sup>, where 
U and V have orthonormal columns,
V<sup>t</sup> is the transpose of V,
and T is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred).

The algorithm `randUTV` is developed primarily
to be a fast and easily parallelized alternative
to algorithms for computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
`randUTV` provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD for problems
such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear systems,
determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix, etc.
Moreover, `randUTV` produces
highly accurate approximations to the singular values of A.
Unlike the SVD,
the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV factorization in an
incremental, single-stage, and non-iterative way, making it
possible to halt the factorization process 
once a specified tolerance has been met.

The new code can be downloaded from https://github.com/flame/randutv/.

The algorithm was originally implemented using the FLAME/C API with 
a variation of the compact WY transform we call the UT transform. 

However, an implementation that uses the original compact WY transform 
is also supplied so that many routines from LAPACK can be employed in a 
seamless fashion.

Both implementations will eventually be included in the libflame library: 
https://github.com/flame/libflame/

We will appreciate feedback from the community on the use of this code.

## Performance benefit

Several experiments demonstrate that in comparison to column pivoted QR, 
which is another factorization that is often used 
as a relatively economic alternative to the SVD,
`randUTV` compares favorably in terms of speed while providing far higher
accuracy.

## Details

We offer two variants of the code:

* LAPACK-compatible pure C code: 
  It uses compact WY transformations.
  The sources are stored in the folder `lapack_compatible_sources`.

* LAPACK-like libflame code: 
  It uses compact UT transformations.
  This code resembles the algorithm in the paper.
  The sources are stored in the folder `libflame_sources`.

### Details of LAPACK-compatible pure C code: 

The new code contains the following main routine:

```
int NoFLA_UTV_WY_blk_var2(
        int m_A, int n_A, double * buff_A, int ldim_A,
        int build_u, double * buff_U, int ldim_U,
        int build_v, double * buff_V, int ldim_V,
        int nb_alg, int pp, int n_iter ) {
//
// randUTV: It computes the UTV factorization of matrix A.
//
// Main features:
//   * BLAS-3 based.
//   * Compact WY transformations are used instead of UT transformations.
//
// Matrices A, U, and V must be stored in column-order.
// If provided, matrices U,V must be square.
//
// Arguments:
// ----------
// m_A:      Number of rows of matrix A.
// n_A:      Number of columns of matrix A.
// buff_A:   Address of data in matrix A. Matrix to be factorized.
// ldim_A:   Leading dimension of matrix A.
// build_u:  If build_u==1, matrix U is built.
// buff_U:   Address of data in matrix U.
// ldim_U:   Leading dimension of matrix U.
// build_v:  If build_v==1, matrix V is built.
// buff_V:   Address of data in matrix V.
// ldim_V:   Leading dimension of matrix V.
// nb_alg:   Block size. Usual values for nb_alg are 32, 64, etc.
// pp:       Oversampling size. Usual values for pp are 5, 10, etc.
// n_iter:   Number of "power" iterations. Usual values are 2.
//
```

This routine is stored in the file `NoFLA_UTV_WY_blk_var2.c`.
The file `simple_test.c` contains a main program to test it.

### Details of LAPACK-like libflame code: 

The new code contains the following main routine:

```

              int build_v, FLA_Obj V, int nb_alg, int pp, int n_iter ) {
//
// randUTV: It computes the UTV factorization of matrix A.
//
// Main features:
//   * BLAS-3 based.
//   * Use of Householder UT block transformations.
//   * Use of libflame.
//
// Matrices A, U, and V must be stored in column-order.
